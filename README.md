# Medico
<strong>Medico</strong> is an API that you are building for a healthcare application. The purpose of the API is to provide a way for users of the healthcare application to access and manage their healthcare-related data, such as medical records, appointments, prescriptions, and test results, among other things.

Some of the endpoints that the Medico API could have might include:
<ol>
<li>User authentication endpoints for registering new users and logging in existing users</li>
<li>Appointment scheduling endpoints for creating, updating, and cancelling appointments</li>
<li>Prescription management endpoints for managing medication orders and refills</li>
<li>Medical record endpoints for viewing and updating a user's medical history and health status</li>
<li>Test result endpoints for accessing the results of medical tests that the user has undergone</li>
</ol>

The specific endpoints and functionality of the Medico API will depend on the requirements of the healthcare application that it is being built for, as well as any regulatory or privacy considerations that need to be taken into account.
